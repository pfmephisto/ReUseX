// The single, machine-readable source of truth for what each pipeline stage
// consumes and produces in a `.rux` project (#246).
//
// This table used to exist three times: as a hand-written `switch` in
// `core::check_stage_inputs()`, as
// `rux::validation::validate_*_prerequisites()` in the CLI, and as prose in
// docs/CONTRACTS.md. The three could — and did — disagree, so `rux validate
// --stage mesh` could pass while `rux create mesh` refused. Everything now
// reads THIS table:
//
//   core::check_stage_inputs()   interprets it against a ProjectDB
//   pipeline::run_stage()        refuses through check_stage_inputs()
//   apps/rux                     gates every subcommand through it
//   docs/CONTRACTS.md            is a prose mirror, asserted by a unit test
//
// Layering (STANDARDS §1): the table is pure data — enums and names — with no
// PCL/CGAL/ProjectDB in it, so it sits at the lowest layer every consumer can
// reach. `pipeline` is Layer 4 and could not be read from `core`; `utils` would
// divorce it from the ProjectDB naming semantics it describes. Hence `core`.
