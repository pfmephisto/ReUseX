// of `pipeline::run_stage()` are the same code, so a missing/misaligned
// prerequisite fails identically whichever door the user came through.

// `pipeline_stage_names()` come from <reusex/core/stage_contract.hpp>, included
// above.

/// input collapses to the override so the check is exact rather than lenient.
