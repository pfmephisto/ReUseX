// Database-level pipeline stage execution (#265, Phase 1).
//
// The algorithms in segmentation/ and reconstruction/ are pure functions over
// PCL clouds; the "load the named clouds out of a ProjectDB, run the algorithm,
// write the results back, record it in pipeline_log" wrapper used to live only
// inside apps/rux/src/create/*.cpp. This header lifts that wrapper DOWN into
// the library so both `rux create <stage>` and the GUI/daemon job runners drive
// the exact same code path (issue #265: "shared logic goes DOWN into the
// library, not sideways between apps").
//
// Layering: this is the `pipeline` module, which sits ABOVE the Layer-3 peers
// (segmentation / reconstruction / slam / io) — it is the one place allowed to
// link several of them at once. See docs/STANDARDS.md §1.
