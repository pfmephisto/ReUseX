// P2 of issue #225: wide-baseline loop-closure edges for the plane-landmark
// pose graph.
//
// The plane-landmark back-end (PlaneGraphOptimizer) fixes *local* global
// consistency where frames co-observe the same walls, but it cannot constrain
// two temporally distant views of the same place that share no plane landmark
// chain — the "basin problem" from docs/research/registration-improvements.md.
// This module supplies the missing wide-baseline constraints: it proposes
// loop-candidate frame pairs, matches them with image features, lifts the
// matches to metric 3D using the stored per-frame depth, and estimates a robust
// metric relative pose (RANSAC 3D-3D). Each accepted pair becomes a
// gtsam::BetweenFactor<Pose3> loop edge fed into the SAME GncOptimizer graph,
// so a wrong edge is down-weighted rather than corrupting the solution.
//
// Front-end design (research doc §Q2, commercial-safe path): the matcher is
// abstracted behind FrameMatcher so the default OpenCV ORB detector+matcher
// (BSD, no model weights, verifiable offline) can be swapped for a learned
// matcher (EfficientLoFTR / LightGlue+ALIKED via the existing TensorRT backend)
// without touching the graph wiring. The bundled superpoint.pt is
// non-commercial and deliberately NOT used here.
//
// This header carries no GTSAM include (STANDARDS.md §2); the factor lives in
// PlaneGraphOptimizer.cpp.
