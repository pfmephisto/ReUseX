// Issue #236: wide-baseline pose-graph loop edges derived from 360 panoramas.
//
// WHY A PANORAMA IS THE RIGHT SENSOR FOR THIS
// -------------------------------------------
// The plane-landmark back-end (PlaneGraphOptimizer) makes frames that co-observe
// the same wall mutually consistent, but two temporally distant views of the
// same place that share no plane-landmark chain are left unconstrained — the
// "basin problem" of docs/research/registration-improvements.md. The ORB
// front-end in LoopClosure.hpp attacks that by matching frame PAIRS, which
// requires the two narrow-FOV frames to overlap each other.
//
// A 360 panorama sees every direction at once, so a SINGLE panorama routinely
// matches frames that do not overlap each other at all — including frames from
// opposite ends of the capture. Each such panorama is therefore a hub that ties
// a whole group of temporally distant frames together.
//
// WHAT MAKES THE EDGE INFORMATIVE (the one thing to get right)
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// `PanoramaAlignment` resects ONE panorama pose in WORLD coordinates, from frame
// keypoints already transformed to world by their (drifted) seed poses. An edge
// built from that pose would be circular: `T_pano_A^-1 · T_pano_B` would
// reproduce `seed(A)^-1 · seed(B)` and carry exactly ZERO drift-correction
// information — it would restate the drift rather than measure it.
//
// This module therefore resects the panorama INDEPENDENTLY against each matched
// frame, using that frame's keypoints in the frame's OWN optical coordinates:
//
//   T_pano_A  :  pano-from-A, from A's correspondences alone
//   T_pano_B  :  pano-from-B, from B's correspondences alone
//   T_AB = T_pano_A^-1 · T_pano_B          (== pose(A)^-1 · pose(B))
//
// Neither resection reads `sensor_frame_pose`, so `T_AB` is a genuine metric
// measurement of where B sits relative to A. The panorama is a shared, rigid
// intermediate coordinate frame — it never has to be correctly placed in world.
// (A useful consequence: `rux align 360` is NOT a prerequisite. Panorama poses
// are neither read nor written here.)
//
// GUARDRAILS: nothing new is invented. The emitted LoopEdges are the SAME type
// the ORB front-end emits, are gated by the SAME LoopClosureOptions knobs
// (`min_frame_gap`, `min_seed_disagreement`, `max_seed_disagreement`), are
// PCM-filtered as part of the UNION with the other edge sources, and enter the
// SAME GncOptimizer graph — so a wrong panorama edge is down-weighted rather
// than corrupting the solution.
//
// This header carries no GTSAM and no OpenCV include (docs/STANDARDS.md §2).
