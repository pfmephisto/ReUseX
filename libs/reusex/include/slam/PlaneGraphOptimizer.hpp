// ReUseX's first owned global pose-optimization stage. Where Joint Pairwise
// Registration (JointPairwiseRegistration) polishes poses locally via
// frame-to-frame point-to-plane residuals — and provably saturates because
// pairwise energy cannot express global consistency — this optimizer changes
// the objective to *shared global plane landmarks*:
//
//   1. detect the dominant planes each frame sees (from its surfels),
//   2. associate those observations across frames into persistent
//      gtsam::OrientedPlane3 landmarks,
//   3. build a factor graph (per-frame Pose3 + odometry BetweenFactors from the
//      seed poses + one OrientedPlane3Factor per observation + a soft prior on
//      the first pose for gauge), and
//   4. solve it with GncOptimizer (Graduated Non-Convexity) wrapping
//      Levenberg-Marquardt, so a handful of bad plane associations are
//      down-weighted rather than corrupting the global solution.
//
// The surfel extraction and the pose write-back (removal of the constant local
// optical->sensor transform) mirror the JPR path exactly, so the two stages are
// interchangeable in the pipeline.
//
// This header is deliberately free of any GTSAM include (STANDARDS.md §2): the
// factor graph lives entirely in the .cpp.
