// Headless render-to-image (#294).
//
// Renders the contents of a .rux project to an in-memory image without a
// display server. The backend is VTK's offscreen render window: the flake's
// VTK is built with VTK_OPENGL_HAS_EGL, and VTK transparently falls back from
// vtkXOpenGLRenderWindow to vtkEGLRenderWindow when no X/Wayland session is
// reachable, so `env -u DISPLAY rux render ...` renders on the GPU exactly as
// it would with a session attached.
//
// Keep this header light (STANDARDS §2): cv::Mat and ProjectDB are
// forward-declared, and no VTK header is exposed to consumers.
